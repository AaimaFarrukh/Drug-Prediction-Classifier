🧠 Decision Tree Classifier: Drug Prediction Based on Patient Data
This project showcases a Decision Tree Classification model built using a real-world medical dataset to predict the most suitable drug for a patient based on key health features.

🩺 About the Dataset
Imagine you're a medical researcher. You've collected data about patients who all suffered from the same illness and responded positively to one of the following medications:

Drug A

Drug B

Drug C

Drug X

Drug Y

Each patient has these features recorded:

Age

Sex

Blood Pressure (BP)

Cholesterol

Na_to_K (Sodium to Potassium ratio)

The goal? Predict which drug a future patient is likely to respond to, using this health data.

🌲 What This Project Does
This project uses the Decision Tree algorithm (via scikit-learn) to:

✅ Train a classifier on the patient dataset
✅ Visualize the trained decision tree for interpretability
✅ Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy
✅ Analyze feature importance and model insights

📦 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

pandas for data manipulation

matplotlib for visualization

scikit-learn for machine learning (DecisionTreeClassifier)

🔍 Project Highlights
✅ Achieved ~98% model accuracy 🤯

🌳 Visualized the full decision-making tree

🧪 Preprocessed both numerical & categorical data

📊 Used entropy to determine feature splits

🔍 Explored feature importance and model interpretability

🧠 Why Decision Trees?
Decision Trees are:

Easy to understand and visualize

Great for multi-class classification problems

Able to handle both categorical and numerical data

Powerful when interpretability is important (like in healthcare)
